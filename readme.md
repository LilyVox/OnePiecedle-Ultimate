# One-Piece-Dle

This is meant to be a more complete version of the currently available "Onepiecedle". Onepiecedle is more hand-crafted, but my idea is an evolving version that can update itself with every character that comes out to the anime or manga.

## Installation

Currently it's very manual. You'll need to:

- cd into src/backend
- open dataHandler and call `initCharacterData()`
- 

## Features

- [ ] Arc-dependant information
  - [ ] Every Arc
  - [ ] Manga and Anime
  - [ ] Live action
  - [ ] Movies and Anime filler characters too?
  - [ ] Robust and fuzzy search
- Able to look at characters who fit a criteria, i.e. everyone from Skypeia or Usopp's Crew

## todo:

- Add button to submit guess
  - clicking in the list should populate the search bar, then the guess button should apply it
- add delay revealing the fields instead of them all showing at once
- make it look prettier...

so much regex and data cleaning...
